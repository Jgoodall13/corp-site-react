          (WAUKEGAN, IL, September 3, 2024) -- Overture Promotions has acquired
          Brandon (pronounced “brand on”), a branded merchandise agency
          headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, with an office in Shanghai.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          Originally founded as a logistics and trading company in 1987, Brandon
          began working with its first branded merchandise customer in 2000, and
          Volvo Cars is still a customer two decades later. Brandon was acquired
          by PUMA in 2009, and sold back to management in 2016, with PUMA still
          a customer today.{" "}

          “The Brandon team is so impressive, from their wildly creative
          approach to creating custom branded merchandise portfolios for their
          customers, to their world-class systems and infrastructure, to their
          well-run distribution center,” said Gilley. “We are already hitting
          the ground running, collaborating on several global customers and
          creating opportunities to learn from each other – a true win-win for
          our customers and employees.”
