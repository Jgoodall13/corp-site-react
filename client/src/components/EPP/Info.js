          Owner and CEO Michelle Sheldon will step down from her role and
          collaborate with Overture leadership for a smooth transition.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          EPP was founded in 2008 – one of the first of its kind with a mission
          to provide environmentally and socially responsible promotional
          products. Sheldon had lived and worked in the Netherlands, which
          inspired her passion and approach to building EPP, including the
          company’s proprietary supplier and product scorecard system that
          tracks and measures Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and
          Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) performance.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          EPP works with many public sector customers and non-profits, including
          colleges and universities, government entities, waste management, and
          environmental groups, as well as private sector customers.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          “We are thrilled to be adding this passionate team of sustainability
          experts,” said Jo Gilley, CEO of Overture. “We will use their product
          and supply chain scorecards in our customer webstores and will apply
          our in-house services to expanding their customer relationships – a
          win for ALL of our customers.”{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          “It was important to me to find the right successor for Eco
          Promotional Products, which has been growing year after year,” said
          Sheldon. “I knew right away that Overture had the right culture, core
          values, focus on sustainability, leadership, and resources to make an
          even bigger sustainable impact.”
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          The acquisition is backed by Overture’s parent company, Westbridge
          Capital, a Canadian private equity firm with a long-term view of
          growing its portfolio companies. EPP joins Brandon, Overture’s EU
          subsidiary headquartered in Sweden as a member of the Overture
          Marketing Group.{" "}
